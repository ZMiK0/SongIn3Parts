# SongIn3Parts

---
## Description
Have you ever wished you could segment a song and transition between its parts for a role-playing game, similar to how some video games do in cutscenes?

**If so, this is the program for you.**

You can divide your song into three or more parts *(Beginning, Chorus, and End)* to enhance the immersion in your game like never before.
